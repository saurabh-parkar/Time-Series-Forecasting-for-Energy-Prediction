# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Energy-Prediction


A large-scale investor/financial institution would only express interest in investing in energy-saving investments if they consider it to be profitable in the long run. Ideally, this would mean that any energy-saving methods employed would require them to wait a considerable duration of time to determine if the methods employed actually save enough energy for it to be a profitable investment. By predicting the future energy consumption of different meters based on past energy consumption, we would be able to provide better estimates of these energy-saving investments thus inclining them to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.

The project seeks to predict the energy meter reading of buildings across four energy types - (0) Electricity, (1) Chilled Water, (2) Steam, and (4) Hot Water, based on historic usage rates and observed weather over a one-year timeframe. Our primary goal is to develop a model to accurately predict the energy meter reading of each energy type for each of the buildings in our dataset.

Our methods include developing time-series forecasting models using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and classical models using Linear Regression and LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Method) and determine if our dataset works best by a time-series approach or a regression approach.
